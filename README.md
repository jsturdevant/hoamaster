# The Isle of Trees HOA Site

The site is built with a basic [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework, using the config.toml file to dictate a final version of the build be created inside of the /docs directory for hosting purposes.

## Setup Hugo
If you are going to maintain this site, you are going to need to start with [acquiring](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) Hugo. Once you have Hugo, you can clone this repository to your local system and modify it to your hearts desire. To test a build, run `hugo server -D`. Once you are confident the page looks how you want, you need to execute `hugo -D`.
