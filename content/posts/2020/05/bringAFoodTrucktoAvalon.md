As we continue into these months of social distancing and restrictions on businesses opening, a lot of you have had excellent ideas for bringing food, drink, and treats to Avalon! We want to encourage you to continue to bring forward these ideas and to work with the Board to get them approved, a seamless process.

Below is a tested-proven way to get your favorite vendor to come to Avalon:

1. Reach out to the Board via the [contact form](http://avalonhoasc.com/contact) for approval on bringing your vendor to Avalon. You can also reach out to Charlie Smith, HOA Board President, on Facebook via the [Avalon Homeowners Association](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1720689101561189) page.
2. Once you have approval from the HOA Board, go ahead and reach out to the vendor. Don't know how? Start with the vendor's Facebook page and see if they have a number you can call or a chat function on their page. This is a great way to make contact with the vendors.
3. Coordinate a day and time with the vendor and a location around Avalon for them to park. If you are like many of us who live on one of the main thoroughfares, it may be challenging to have them park near your home. If this is your situation, work with your neighbors to coordinate a cul-de-sac parking spot or reach out to the Board for assistance.
4. Let Avalon know! Post on the wiki page & feel free to reach out to me, [Mat Sturdevant](mailto:mathew.sturdevant@gmail.com) and I will be happy to help advertise with you!
5. If you are looking for more people for your event, be sure to reach out to our neighbors on Facebook! Braewick's community is run by [Meghann Lapine Crabb](https://www.facebook.com/SurveyorChick), and she can help get the message out to their community. If you have any other contacts around the area, they may be able to help as well!

__Warning:__ Some vendors may have a minimum sale point and will hold you responsible for meeting it. They may take a deposit to do so. If this is a risk you are willing to take, please make sure you advertise well to ensure you aren't paying unexpectedly.

Thank you again for everyone's hard work at making this a more interactive community and we look forward to getting together soon (socially distanced, of course)!
