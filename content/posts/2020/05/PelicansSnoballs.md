A huge thank you goes out to our neighbor, Michelle Cochcroft, for her coordination of and most generous invite to the community for the Pelican's Snoballs truck coming out on the 11th of May. They will be here from 4:00 to 5:00 across the street from 802 [Annondale Court](http://www.avalonhoasc.com/contact).
