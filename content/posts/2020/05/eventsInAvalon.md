Thank you all for coming out for our past two events: Ice Cream with Sweet Pea's and Snowballs with Pelican's. As summer will soon settle in, we hope to have more events for the community coming up thanks to your awesome neighbors. We try to get out and take some pictures at the events and we've got two to share this month!

See you around the neighborhood!
