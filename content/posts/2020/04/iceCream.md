This coming Saturday, May 2, from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM, Sweet Pea's Ice Cream Parlor will be coming to Avalon, parking their mobile Ice Cream truck very close to the four-way stop, across the street from 150 Sandstone. Ice cream prices are between $4 and $8 a cone, depending on how big of a cone you are looking for. This event represents an opportunity for us all to get out and enjoy each other's company while still social distancing. We hope to see you there!
